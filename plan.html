<h1>CP1406 - Assignment 1 - Project Plan - CossiePlay</h1>
<p><strong>Name:</strong> Matthew Cabinian<br>
<strong>Login:</strong> JC474421</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>Cossieplay has tasked me with creating a website so that their business is able to reach a bigger target audience. 
<br>The website is meant to showcase the services the business provides which is costume making and 
<br>hosting cosplay parties every 1st saturday of each month.
<br>CossiePlay hopes that the website will improve their business with more people asking for custom costumes 
<br>and with more than 30 people attending their monthly party.
</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>In order for the website to be successful, the website has to invite the target audience 
<br>to sign up for the parties and to order custom costumes or buy any available second hand costumes. 
<br>We measure the amount of people registered for parties and the amount of orders taken</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>CossiePlay's target audience are high schoolers and young adults with an age range of 16 to 25 or over. 
<br>CossiePlay chose this age range because most of high school students or young adults are usually socially awkward.
<br>They believe that this hobby is really about having fun and being creative with your costume 
<br>and can allow this target audince to experience a huge community
